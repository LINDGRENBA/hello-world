# hello-world
I have been to Japan 3 times, once with an exchange program from my home town of Olympia, then again in college to study Japanese for the summer in Tokyo and finally to teach English for a year in Izumo. I taught for roughly 3 years and enjoyed the teaching part, but not the endless prep work at home, so I switched careers. Now I'm a dental hygienist and even though there is a lot that I love about it, my schedule can be very stressful and I work very long days. Shortly after I started working as a hygienist, I began wanting to learn different skills to challenge myself, be more well rounded and marketable, or for just plain fun to have something to do outside of work besides cleaning my apartment and walking my dog. Here's a list of some random things I enjoy: sewing, drinking coffee, cooking healthy foods, hiking, drinking coffee, hanging out around a campfire with a group of friends and a good beer, going to the dog park with my dog, drinking more coffee and learning new things.
